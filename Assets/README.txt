Okay so the story behind the scene is there is a little bee, and he finds a flower.
He lands on the flower and finds some pollen, and after he collects his pollen he shakely gets back in the air, because pollen is kinda heavy for such a small bee.
He's so excited to find this pollen that he does a little happy bounce and spin, and then bounces again and zooms off to tell his friends about his pollen.

The principles of animation I implemented were:
Anticipation (bouncing)
Slow in and out (slow rise off of the flower)
Secondary action (the flower tilting and swaying)

And finally the emotion I was trying to convey was happiness

Because we could all use a little pick me up right now.
